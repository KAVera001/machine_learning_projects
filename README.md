This repository contains various projects that I worked on during either my free time or they were part of the course.
Files with classification models:
1. MultivariateDataAnalysis_diabetes_classification.ipynb - The final project for Multivariate data Analysis. The project was completed in collaboration with Ksenia Alexander.
   The project aims to predict the diabetes class based on different health factors. Several binary classification models were tested (Logistic regression and SVM).
   The dimention reduction methods such as PCA and SVD were implemented and compared as well.
2.engine_crash_recognition.ipynb - binary classification problem. zthe idea is to predict the engine crash based on the previous behavior.
